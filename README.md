# Learning Canvas in javaFX

### Introduction

The JavaFX Canvas API provides a custom texture that you can write to. 
It is defined by classes Canvas, CanvasBuilder, and GraphicsContext in the javafx.scene.canvas package. 
Using this API involves creating a Canvas object, obtaining its GraphicsContext, and invoking drawing operations to render your custom shapes on screen. 
Because the Canvas is a Node subclass, it can be used in the JavaFX scene graph.
